title: In search of an editor with a server/client split - Part 1

Things I like:
- vim keybindings in the file browser 

Things I dislike: 
- `:` brings up the command palette every time you hit it. I habitually save
  files (`:w`) in order to run my code formatter. I really don't like how
  disruptive the command palette is.
