title: In search of an editor with a server/client split - Part 1

Things I like:

- vim keybindings in the file browser
- AI integration is pretty great, especially the streaming bash

Things I dislike:

- `:` brings up the whole command palette. I habitually save files (`:w`) in order to run my code
  formatter. I really don't like how disruptive the command palette is.
- AI integration
    - Some bash tasks timed out, but didn't successfully kill the `cargo test` processes
