This is a test of sidenotes. Here's some text with a sidenote.{{< sidenote >}}This is the first sidenote. It should appear in the margin on large screens, or toggle inline on smaller screens.{{< /sidenote >}} The main text continues after the sidenote reference.

Here's another paragraph with more content. Sometimes you want to add additional context{{< sidenote >}}Like this second sidenote, which provides supplementary information without interrupting the flow of the main text.{{< /sidenote >}} without breaking up your main argument.

And a third paragraph with yet another aside.{{< sidenote >}}Sidenotes can contain **bold text**, _italics_, and even `code`.{{< /sidenote >}} This demonstrates that multiple sidenotes work correctly with automatic numbering.
