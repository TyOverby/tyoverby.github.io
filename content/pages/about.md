I'm a software engineer with a passion for systems programming, compilers, and programming language design.  These days I mostly write OCaml at \$dayjob, but I've worked in loads of languages, and particularly enjoy using Rust and Java Script.

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss any of these topics or have questions about my blog posts.
