If I'm going to be using a computer for $n$ hours a day, the machine and peripherals had better be
good! This is a list of what I'm currently using.

## Desktop

In 2025 I made [a custom build](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/LBzWPJ) to house a pair of 4090's that
landed in my lap. It's very overkill for what I use it for (programming and minecraft), but I hope
to do some ML research soon, so maybe it'll eventually see some use.

I also keep a
[Puget Systems compact workstation](https://www.pugetsystems.com/solutions/3d-design-workstations/blender/buy-358/)
under my desk, and it's the home for things like my Mincraft server.

## Laptop

13" Macbook Pro. It's got Apple Silicon, but I couldn't tell you which version; maybe M2? It works
well enough that I haven't been tempted yet to go and look for an upgrade.

## Mouse

[Logitech MX Master](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-3s.910-007500). I'm still on
the version that uses micro-usb to charge, which is annoying.

## Keyboard

I've been rocking the [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) for several years now, and I'm
really happy with it. [Here's my config](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/zeejM/latest/0)

When the [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager) came out, I gave it a shot and although the short
travel distance on the switches were great, I couldn't deal with the "missing" row of keys
underneath the alphabetics.

## Monitor

I use a single
[Asus ProArt](https://www.asus.com/us/displays-desktops/monitors/proart/proart-display-6k-pa32qcv/)
monitor. It's 32" and has a 6k resolution.

I recently tried the
[ASUS ROG Swift](https://rog.asus.com/us/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-swift-oled-pg32ucdm/) but
found that the subpixel layout on OLED monitors ruins subpixel antialiasing, and with a mediocre
pixel density, text is noticeably blurry.

## Speakers

I have the [Kef LSX II](https://us.kef.com/products/lsx-2?variant=43006079467767) speakers on my
desk, and they sound great! When I first got them, there were stuttering issues when connecting
wirelessly from my phone, but I haven't noticed it in a while; not sure what happened.
