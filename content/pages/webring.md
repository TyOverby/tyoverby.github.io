There is still wonder and beauty on the internet. Here are some sites and blogs
that bring me joy.

- [eieio.games](https://eieio.games/) Nolen makes multiplayer internet
  experiences and then shares them with us.
- [janet.guide](https://janet.guide/) Is it possible to fall in
  love with a programming language through the writing style of a book
  describing it? Ian shows us that yes.
- [jsomers.net](https://jsomers.net/) James is a programmer and journalist and
  is the reason that I've bought several magazine and newspaper subscriptions.
